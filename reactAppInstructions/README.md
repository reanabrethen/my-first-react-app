# React App Assignment

## Task Description

Create a React application and upload it to GitHub. You can submit the link in Google Classroom..

### Project Requirements

1. Use the 'npm create vite@latest' command to create a React application named 'my-first-react-app'.

2. Develop five distinct components: 'header', 'sidebar', 'body', 'footer', and 'square/box' (children).

3. Assign unique background colors to each of the components.

4. In the 'sidebar':
   - Implement an unordered list with three different colors. When a color is clicked, it should change the background color of the sidebar to the selected one.

5. In the 'body':
   - Include an image and a descriptive paragraph.
   - Below the description, add three square elements by reusing the 'square/box' component. These squares should be centered on the page.

6. In the 'square/box' component (which belongs to the 'body'):
   - Pass down a 'name' prop to each square. The names should be 'square 1', 'square 2', and 'square 3' and should be displayed within each square.
   - Provide a background image for each square.

7. In the 'footer':
   - Include a copyright notice and your name.

8. In the 'header':
   - Display your name.
